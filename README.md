# NoteTakingApp - C#

This is my first C# project! Using ASP.NET Web Forms, I created a simple note taking app with functional "Load", "Delete", "New Note" and "Save" buttons.
Please clone this repository to your pc to experience the functionality.

-  "Save" button - after writing text in the "Title" and "Note" section, clicking save will add it to the left hand side previois notes list.
-  "New Note" button - this will clear any existing text in the "Title" and "Note" section for you to start writing a new note.
-  "Load" button - click on any previous existing notes on the left hand side and then click "Load" for it to appear in the notes section ready for editing.
-  "Delete" button - after selecting a previous existing note, you can then click the delete buttont to remove from list of notes.
